# Arrrrrrrr
Hello there pirate!

Welcome to the swashbuckling pirate ship collection where you can create, read, update and delete pirrrrate ships.
To start the service you just have to execute the `start-pirate-service.sh` or `start-pirate-service.bat` depending on your operrrating system.
If you start the service with the provided script, the website magically opens in your preferred browser.

If this somehow does not work you can simply execute the `docker-compose up -d` command in your terminal.
Once the service is running you can go on the website an start doing whatever you have to do.
